# Langchain Falcon LLM Chainlit (LFLC)

I am just playing around with the Falcon LLM implementation. This is not a serious project but you can use it as a starting point for your own project.

## Requirements
```
npm install -g @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli
echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > ~/.commitlintrc.js


```


## Getting Started
```bash
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```
